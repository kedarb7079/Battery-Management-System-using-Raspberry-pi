# README File - Team The Futurists

## Requirements:
- Adafruit_DHT library must be installed on Raspberry Pi.

## Key Points:
1. As per the flow diagram, the setup has been completed successfully.
2. Data from the sensors has been read successfully.
3. Data has been stored successfully on the cloud server (ThingSpeak).
4. Live data of BMS can be shared by adding a Gmail ID of any person or company.

5. A .csv file of data values has been successfully obtained for further processing.
6. Currently, ML algorithms like Linear Regression Analysis are being worked on.

## Future Work on Algorithms:
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
